To use this, you will need a discord Webhook.

Access your Webhook's Token, and put it through "obfuscate(token, x, y, z)".
Example: "obfuscate('328f72ha620', 0, 2, 18)"
You will need to remember what x, y, and z are.


Send the target to "index.html/?user=username?code=x-y-z"
The username is optional, but you need to replace x, y, and z with the numbers you obfuscated with.
In the above example, you would need to send them to index.html?code=0-2-18
